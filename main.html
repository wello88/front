        <h2>Habit 1: Drink Water</h2>
        <p>To function properly, all the cells and organs of the body need water.

            Here are some reasons our body needs water: <br>

            1. It lubricates the joints

            Cartilage, found in joints and the disks of the spine, contains around 80 percent water. Long-term
            dehydration can reduce the joints’ shock-absorbing ability, leading to joint pain. <br>

            2. It forms saliva and mucus

            Saliva helps us digest our food and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist. This prevents friction and
            damage. Drinking water also keeps the mouth clean. Consumed instead of sweetened beverages, it can also
            reduce tooth decay. <br>

            3. It delivers oxygen throughout the body

            Blood is more than 90 percent water, and blood carries oxygen to different parts of the body. <br>

            4. It boosts skin health and beauty

            With dehydration, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin disorders and premature wrinkling. <br>


            5. It regulates body temperature

            Water that is stored in the middle layers of the skin comes to the skin’s surface as sweat when the body
            heats up. As it evaporates, it cools the body. In sport.

            Some scientists have suggested thatTrusted Source when there is too little water in the body, heat storage
            increases and the individual is less able to tolerate heat strain.

            Having a lot of water in the body may reduce physical strain if heat stress occurs during exercise. However,
            more research is needed into these effects.Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining overall health. Aim
            to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Water helps to keep your body functioning properly and can
            improve your skin, digestion, and energy levels.</p>

        <h2>Habit 2: Eat Balanced Meals</h2>
        <p>This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food
            and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.

            This page covers healthy eating advice for the general population.

            People with special dietary needs or a medical condition should ask their doctor or a registered dietitian
            for advice. Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins into your diet. A
            balanced diet helps maintain energy levels, supports your immune system, and promotes overall well-being.

    <div id="habit3" class="section">
        <h2>Habit 3: Exercise Regularly</h2>
        <p> Exercise controls weight
            Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep off lost weight. When you take part in
            physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.

            Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise
            every day. Any amount of activity is better than none. To gain the benefits of exercise, just get more
            active throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household
            chores. Consistency is key.<br>

            2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases
            Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight is,
            being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases
            unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which lowers your risk of
            heart and blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.

            Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including:

            Stroke.
            Metabolic syndrome.
            High blood pressure.
            Type 2 diabetes.
            Depression.
            Anxiety.
            Many types of cancer.
            Arthritis.
            Falls.
            It also can help improve cognitive function and helps lower the risk of death from all causes.<br>

            3. Exercise improves mood
            Need an emotional lift? Or need to lower stress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help.
            Physical activity stimulates many brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less
            anxious.

            You also may feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost
            your confidence and improve your self-esteem.<br>

            4. Exercise boosts energy
            Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength
            and boost your endurance.

            Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more
            efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores. <br>

            5. Exercise promotes better sleep
            Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen
            your sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep.Engage in
            physical activities like walking, jogging, or cycling for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular exercise helps
            improve cardiovascular health, boosts mood, and increases stamina.</p>

        <h2>Habit 4: Get Enough Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good night’s
            sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.

            But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance,
            mood, and health.

            Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from
            heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.

            There’s more to good sleep than just the hours spent in bed, says Dr. Marishka Brown, a sleep expert at NIH.
            “Healthy sleep encompasses three major things,” she explains. “One is how much sleep you get. Another is
            sleep quality—that you get uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The last is a consistent sleep schedule.”

            People who work the night shift or irregular schedules may find getting quality sleep extra challenging. And
            times of great stress—like the current pandemic—can disrupt our normal sleep routines. But there are many
            things you can do to improve your sleep.

            Sleep for Repair
            Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest,
            says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, who studies sleep at the University of Rochester.

            “But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, sleep helps prepare your
            brain to learn, remember, and create.

            Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage system that removes toxins during
            sleep.

            “When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” sh Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.
            Proper sleep is crucial for physical and mental health, affecting everything from mood to cognitive
            function.</p>

        <h2>Habit 5: Practice Mindfulness</h2>
        <p> Paying attention to what’s going on right this second can be hard. We often spend more time thinking about
            what’s coming up in the future. Or dwelling on things in the past we can’t change. We can miss out on
            experiencing the present.

            It’s possible to train yourself to focus on the present moment. You become aware of what’s going on inside
            and around you—your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and environment. You observe these moments without
            judgment. This is called mindfulness.

            “We’re looking at our thoughts and feelings with curiosity, gentleness, and kindness,” explains Dr. Eric
            Loucks, director of the Mindfulness Center at Brown University.

            Mindfulness has its roots in Buddhist meditation. Meditation is a practice that aims to increase awareness
            of the mind and concentration.

            In recent years, mindfulness has become a household term. Mindfulness programs are now commonly found in
            schools, workplaces, and hospitals.

            Mindfulness can involve a sitting meditation that’s practiced in a quiet space. In this practice, you focus
            on your breathing or sensations in your body. If your mind wanders—like thoughts popping in about things you
            need to do—you try to return your mind to the present moment.

            But mindfulness doesn’t have to be done sitting still or in silence. You can integrate the practice into
            things you do every day, like walking or eating. You can also be mindful while interacting with others.

            Health Benefits of Mindfulness
            Studies suggest that focusing on the present can have a positive impact on health and well-being.

            Mindfulness-based treatments have been shown to reduce anxiety and depression. There’s also evidence that
            mindfulness can lower blood pressure and improve sleep. It may even help people cope with pain.

            “For many chronic illnesses, mindfulness meditation seems to improve quality of life and reduce mental
            health symptoms,” says Dr. Zev Schuman-Olivier of Harvard University.

            One of the first mindfulness-based therapies was used for depression. Many studies have shown that it can be
            effective for some people.

            Mindfulness appears to help with depression in two ways. First, it helps you develop the ability to stay
            grounded in the present, explains Dr. Sona Dimidjian of the University of Colorado Boulder. She studies the
            use of mindfulness-based treatments to prevent relapse of depression, including among pregnant women.

            With depression, “your attention can get hijacked into the past or future,” she explains. You spend time
            focusing on past negative experiences or worrying about things to come.

            Second, mindfulness can help you “de-center” from such thoughts. “It’s like being able to sit on the
            riverbank and watch thoughts floating by like leaves on a stream,” Dimidjian says. “Developing the skill of
            mindfulness can help stop you from being pulled into any one thought and carried down the stream. People
            often experience thoughts like, ‘nothing ever works out for me,’ or ‘it’s always going to be this way. Over
            time, and with practice, you can develop the ability to stand back from these painful thought patterns.”

            Researchers are now studying whether mindfulness training can help with a variety of other conditions,
            including PTSD, eating disorders, and addiction.Engage in activities like meditation or yoga to reduce
            stress and improve mental clarity. Mindfulness practices can enhance your emotional well-being and help you
            manage stress more effectively.</p>

        <h2>Habit 6: Avoid Smoking</h2>
        <p>Smoking tobacco can cause many health problems. Did you know that it can harm your heart and blood vessels?

            Smoking is a risk factor for heart disease, which can lead to heart attack, heart failure, and death. About
            one of every three people in the U.S. dies from heart disease.

            Tobacco smoke contains many toxic chemicals. Once those chemicals get inside your body, they travel around
            in your blood. They can damage your heart and blood vessels. They also affect the cholesterol and fats in
            your blood.

            All this damage can help fats and other debris build up on blood vessels. The blood vessels can become
            narrower. That prevents blood from flowing through as easily. Not as much oxygen and nutrients can get to
            the heart. That’s how heart disease develops.
            Those narrow blood vessels also raise your blood pressure. That pressure puts stress on your heart.

            You can reduce your risk of heart disease by not smoking. Avoiding secondhand smoke also reduces your risk.
